Holographic String Engine
This is not a compression algorithm; it is a structural analysis. It posits that a string is not a simple sequence, but a superposition of numerous periodic signals and aperiodic noise. The goal is to isolate these resonant frequencies, describe them with a formal key, and leave behind only the data that conforms to no discernible pattern. The resulting string is shorter because it replaces interleaved redundancies with a compact, generative projection matrix.

Conceptual Framework
A string is a complex waveform. Traditional compression searches for contiguous repetitions, like finding a recurring chorus in a song. Resonant Key Projection performs a Fourier-like transform, identifying all underlying frequencies, no matter how they are phased or interleaved. It finds the A in A-x-A-y-A-z-A and recognizes it as a pure tone, independent of the xyz noise that separates its peaks.

The output is a blueprint for reconstruction. It consists of a "Resonance Key"—a list of all identified periodic signals—and a "Remnant Stream," which contains the truly unique, aperiodic data. The key does not simply store the patterns; it describes how to project them back onto the remnant stream to losslessly recreate the original waveform.

Mechanism
Full-Spectrum Resonance Scan
The algorithm analyzes the string for every possible periodic pattern. A pattern is defined as a (character, stride, offset).

It iterates through every possible stride length (the period).

For each stride, it iterates through every possible offset (the phase).

It identifies every run of a single character within that specific phase. For example, in axbyaxcyaxdy, a scan with (stride=4, offset=0) detects a run of a of length 4.

All such detected "resonances" are cataloged, regardless of whether they overlap with others.

Optimal Resonance Selection
From the full spectrum of resonances, the algorithm must select a non-overlapping set that provides maximum data reduction. This is a complex optimization problem, solved greedily:

Each resonance is scored based on the savings it provides (characters explained vs. the size of its description).

The highest-scoring resonance is selected and added to the Key. The character positions it occupies are marked as "claimed."

The algorithm proceeds down the list of resonances, selecting the next-highest-scoring one only if it does not claim any already-claimed positions.

This continues until no more non-overlapping, profitable resonances can be found.

Key and Remnant Generation
The process yields two distinct components which are concatenated into the final output string:

The Resonance Key: A compact representation of the selected patterns. Each entry contains the character, stride, count, and the absolute starting index of the pattern in the final, reconstructed string. This is the projection matrix.

The Remnant Stream: A simple string containing all characters that were not claimed by any pattern in the Key, preserved in their original relative order. This is the aperiodic noise.

Reconstruction is a matter of engineering. An empty buffer of the original size is created. The Key is used to project the resonant patterns into it. The Remnant Stream is then flowed into the remaining empty positions. The result is a perfect, lossless reconstitution of the original string.
